<h1>Run Profitable Campaigns</h1>


<p>Every penny spent in your company must be <em>profitable</em>. Even your non-sales, supportive operations must generate intangible profit like brand trust and customer satisfaction.</p>

<p>But now we will examine how to create and run marketing and sales campaigns to increase revenue. If you spend blindly you can hit the headlines, and, in the same time dig your own grave like <a href='http://shortlogic.com/post/6142108636/groupon-ipo-pass-on-this-deal'>Groupon did</a>.</p>

<p>So focus on profit.</p>

<h2 id='know_your_channels'>Know Your Channels</h2>

<p>Using the industry standard Google Analytics terms every website has the following traffic sources &#8212; in e-commerce we call them sales channels.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Search Traffic</dt><dd>Visitors brought to you by search engines like Google, Bing, Yahoo etc.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Direct Traffic</dt><dd>Visitors who already know you. They go straight to your site without searching or clicking links to your webpage.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Referral Traffic</dt><dd>Visitors coming to your site via links from other sites. As a result of your link exchange or similar activities.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Campaigns</dt><dd>Visits brought to you by online advertising platforms like Google Adwords or Facebook Ads.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>These are the major sources of revenue for your business. You&#8217;ll have to know how they work, how much you can spend on each channel, how much profit they will generate, and when.</p>

<h2 id='measure_your_channels'>Measure Your Channels</h2>

<p>Google and its Analytics software is e-commerce&#8217;s best friend. They track and measure your sales, product performance, channel and campaign performance, even how much revenue the navigation bar on your site generates.</p>

<p>Google Analytics for E-commerce talks business figures, <em>dollars</em>. You don&#8217;t have to use other tools. Google gives you the <strong>Per Visit Value</strong> metric which is exactly what you need.</p>

<p><a href='http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3644199/shopledge.com/article2b.png' title='View larger version'><img alt='Google Analytics for E-commerce / Per Visit Value' src='http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3644199/shopledge.com/article2b.png' /></a></p>

<h3 id='per_visit_value'>Per Visit Value</h3>

<p>The figure above tells us every visit we receive has a $2.22 value. For 7,144 visits we have $15,828 revenue. For 10,000 visits we&#8217;ll probably have $22,220 revenue.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s all. No more magic, calculations, excel sheets.</p>

<p>Since Google is smart the Per Visit Value can be used everywhere. Like telling you which channels are performing better. Or even more if Google Adwords brings more profit than Bing, Yahoo or your e-mail newsletter and affiliates together.</p>

<p>With Per Visit Value you have <strong>a universal metric</strong> measuring your <strong>marketing performance</strong>.</p>

<p>Using this metric what you&#8217;ll have to care about is only to <em>spend less then the Per Visit Value a channel offers.</em></p>

<h2 id='on_planning_successful_campaigns'>On Planning Successful Campaigns</h2>

<p>Shop owners must know campaigns are usually bring new visitors less interested than those who already know you.</p>

<p>Without campaigns your site is reached by more involved audience who found you by their own, looking for something which turns out to be you.</p>

<p>With campaigns visitors are somehow <em>forced</em> to visit your site thus their value, motivation expressed in Conversion Rate and Per Visit Value is lower.</p>

<h3 id='goals'>Goals</h3>

<p>Every campaign must have a clear goal &#8212; acquiring new visitors or making existing customers return &#8212; and must offer a reward for participants.</p>

<p>Caring about your existing customers is usually more profitable than acquiring new customers unless you find niche audience really waiting for you.</p>

<p>Start with making your customers buy more &#8212; then bring new customers and make them, again, to stay with you.</p>

<h3 id='campaign_cost'>Campaign Cost</h3>

<p>Calculating campaign cost, first of all, is determined by the <strong>reach</strong>: how many people will be targeted? And by a <strong>guess</strong> how these less interested visitors will convert to customers.</p>

<p>With the two numbers above you&#8217;ll approximate how much revenue you&#8217;ll generate with a campaign.</p>

<p>To make profit you must create costs lower than the planned revenue.</p>

<h3 id='consider_risk'>Consider Risk</h3>

<p>Calculating revenue is guessing, calculating cost is mathematics.</p>

<p>To stop eventual loss you must first ask yourself: given these costs what is the minimum number of new visitors / customers I must bring in to break even?</p>

<p>Always pay attention to reach the break even point. If that point is met you can let freely the campaign flow, or if not, stop the campaign to avoid more damage.</p>
